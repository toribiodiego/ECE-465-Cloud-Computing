# Distributed Reinforcement Learning for Tic-Tac-Toe with Cloud Deployment

This directory contains my ongoing final project for the **Cloud Computing (ECE-465)** course, focusing on enhancing reinforcement learning (RL) training efficiency and scalability using distributed computing. Specifically, the project leverages Ray's distributed framework to accelerate Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) training for a Tic-Tac-Toe agent.

## Project Overview

**Objective:**  
To significantly improve training performance and scalability for an RL agent by parallelizing Tic-Tac-Toe self-play simulations using Ray. This approach transitions from a single-CPU training setup to a multi-core, multi-node distributed architecture, speeding up the training and deployment lifecycle.
