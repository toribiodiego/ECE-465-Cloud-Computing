### Overview

This independent study provides a practical introduction to cloud computing, focusing on distributed systems, containerization, and modern DevOps practices. Through in-depth exploration of topics like distributed training, multi-threaded programming, and cloud deployment techniques, students gain both theoretical insights and hands-on experience needed to design and scale production-ready applications.

- Multi-processing and network programming  
- Docker and Kubernetes  
- CI/CD pipelines  
- Distributed architectures, consistency, replication, and fault tolerance  
- Cloud-based deployment on virtual and Kubernetes nodes

### Final Project

This project, *Distributed Reinforcement Learning for Tic-Tac-Toe*, explores how to scale CPU-bound reinforcement learning tasks using Ray, Kubernetes, and Docker. Inspired by production challenges in modern cloud environments, the goal is to transition from a single-CPU pipeline to a multi-core, multi-node setup that accelerates self-play simulations and policy updates. By leveraging containerization and distributed computing, the project aims to gain practical insights into resource optimization and scalable cloud deployment for machine learning applications.
